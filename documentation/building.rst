Building
========

Release tars available from https://github.com/mdavidsaver/p4p/releases

The P4P modules requires:

* Python 2.7 or >=3.4
* numpy >=1.6
* nosetests (to run unittests)

* EPICS >= 7.0.1

or

* EPICS Base >= 3.14.12
* pvDataCPP >=7.0.0
* pvAccessCPP >=6.0.0

Build from source
-----------------

Install python dependencies on a Debian Linux host::

   sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python-numpy python-nose

or with PIP::

   pip install -r requirements-deb9.txt

From release tar.::

   curl -L 'https://github.com/mdavidsaver/p4p/releases/download/1.0/p4p-1.0.tar.gz' | tar -xz
   cd p4p-1.0

or from from versioned source.::

   git clone https://github.com/mdavidsaver/p4p.git
   cd p4p

Set location of EPICS modules.  With EPICS >= 7.0.1::

   cat <<EOF > configure/RELEASE.local
   EPICS_BASE=/path/to/epics-base
   EOF
   make

See below for details on building EPICS from source.

By default P4P will build using 'python' found in the system search path.
To explicitly specify a particular version. ::

   make distclean
   make PYTHON=python3.4

Alternately, the full path of the interpreter can be used. ::

   make distclean
   make PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.4

For convenience PYTHON can also be set in configure/CONFIG_SITE

Multiple Python Versions
------------------------

To build for multiple python versions it is necessary to do a partial clean before building
another version.  This will not remove the final tree. ::

    make PYTHON=python2.7
    make PYTHON=python2.7 clean
    make PYTHON=python3.4
    make PYTHON=python3,4 clean

.. note:: If PYTHON= is ever specified, then it must be specified for all targets except 'distclean'.

.. _builddeps:

Building EPICS dependencies
---------------------------

If the necessary EPICS modules are not present, then they may be built from source.
Note that the 'pva2pva' module is not required to build P4P, and may be omitted.
It is used in the :ref:`starting` demo. ::

   sudo apt-get install libreadline6-dev libncurses5-dev perl
   git clone --branch core/master --recursive https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base.git
   make -C epics-base
   echo "EPICS_BASE=$PWD/epics-base" > ../p4p/configure/RELEASE.local

When building against EPICS < 7.0.1 the pvDataCPP and pvAccessCPP modules
must be built separately.

CLI and unittests
-----------------

To run the unittests: ::

   make nose

or (change path as appropriate)::

   PYTHONPATH=$PWD/python2.7/linux-x86_86 nosetests

For testing purposes several simple command line client tools are provided.
For further information run: ::

   PYTHONPATH=$PWD/python2.7/linux-x86_86 python -m p4p.client.cli -h
