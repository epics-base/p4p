Building
========

The P4P modules requires:

* Python 2.7 or >=3.4
* numpy >=1.6
* nosetests (to run unittests)
* EPICS Base >= 3.14.12
* PVDataCPP (unreleased)
* PVAccessCPP (unreleased)

Build from source
-----------------

Fetch the source.::

   git clone https://github.com/mdavidsaver/p4p.git
   cd p4p

Setup on a Debian Linux host::

   sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python-numpy nose

or with PIP::

   pip install -r requirements-deb8.txt
   

Set location of EPICS modules::

   cat <<EOF > configure/RELEASE.local
   PVACCESS=/path/to/pvAccessCPP
   PVDATA=/path/to/pvDataCPP
   EPICS_BASE=/path/to/epics-base
   EOF
   make

By default P4P will build using 'python' found in the system search path.
To explicitly specify a particular version.::

   make distclean
   make PYTHON=python3.4

Alternately, the full path of the interpreter can be used. ::

   make distclean
   make PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.4

For convenience PYTHON can also be set in configure/CONFIG_SITE

Multiple Python Versions
------------------------

To build for multiple python versions it is necessary to do a partial clean before building
another version.  This will not remove the final tree. ::

    make PYTHON=python2.7
    make PYTHON=python2.7 clean
    make PYTHON=python3.4
    make PYTHON=python3,4 clean

Building EPICS dependencies
---------------------------

If the necessary EPICS modules are not present, then they may be built form source as well: ::

   git clone https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base.git
   git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP.git
   git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessCPP.git
   cat <<EOF >  RELEASE.local
   PVACCESS=$PWD/pvAccessCPP
   PVDATA=$PWD/pvDataCPP
   EPICS_BASE=$PWD/epics-base
   EOF
   make -C epics-base -j2
   make -C pvDataCPP -j2
   make -C pvAccessCPP -j2

The ./build-deps.sh script in the source tree provides a working example.
Be warned that this script is meant to be run in the travis-ci.org environment
and is not meant to be run by end users.
It will change files in your $HOME.


CLI and unittests
-----------------

To run the unittests: ::

   make nose

or (change path as approriate)::

   PYTHONPATH=$PWD/python2.7/linux-x86_86 nosetests

For testing purposes several simple command line client tools are provided.
For further information run: ::

   PYTHONPATH=$PWD/python2.7/linux-x86_86 python -m p4p.client.cli -h
