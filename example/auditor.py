"""
In this example we setup a simple auditing mechanism that reports information
about the last audited PV changed (which PV, when, and who by) to an auditor
channel. The record of changes is written to the file `audit.log` file.

NOTE: This code is an example only. This design is not suitable for non-demo
      use.

The two Handlers below demonstrate many of the methods available to a handler.
The Audited handler records only information about (external) `put()`
operations, not (internal) `post()` operations. The Auditor Handler uses
`open()` to record the start of logging, `post()` to record value changes,
and `close()` to record when auditing finished and write its own value at that
time.

Run this script and then make a change to one of its PVs, e.g.
`python -m p4p.client.cli put demo:pv:audited_d=8.8`. Then check the results of
the change, e.g. `python -m p4p.client.cli get demo:pv:auditor`. You should see
the name of the PV that was changed, the identity of the user that made the
change, and the time the change was made.

After making changes you can inspect the log of changes in the "audit.log".
Use of open() and close() means that it's also possible to check when auditing
started and stopped.
