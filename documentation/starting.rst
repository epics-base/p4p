Getting Started
===============

For testing and evaluation, it is recommended to install from pypi.org into a (disposable) virtualenv. ::

    python -m virtualenv p4ptest
    . p4ptest/bin/activate
    python -m pip install -U pip
    python -m pip install p4p
    python -m nose p4p   # Optional: runs automatic tests

With this complete, open three terminal instances.
In the first run a PVA server.  Feel free to replace 'my:pv:name'
with an arbitrary name string everywhere it occurs. ::

    $ python -m p4p.server.cli my:pv:name=int
    ...
    INFO:p4p.server:Running server

In a second terminal run the following. If successful, the last line will end with a zero value. ::

    $ python -m p4p.client.cli monitor my:pv:name
    ...
    my:pv:name Mon Jul  9 19:24:01 2018 0L

And finally, in a third terminal run the following.  If successful, the second terminal should show the new value. ::

    $ python -m p4p.client.cli put my:pv:name=5
    my:pv:name=5

Troubleshooting network issues
------------------------------

If the preceeding didn't work as described, there is likely a networking problem.
Restart both server and client with an added argument '-d'.
Look for lines like: ::

    2018-09-27T17:00:44.164 Broadcast address #0: 10.65.15.255:5076. (not unicast)
    2018-09-27T17:00:44.164 Broadcast address #1: 192.168.210.255:5076. (not unicast)

This indicates the two network interfaces were discovered on this host.
If no interfaces are found, then check the system network configuration.
If interfaces are found, ensure that no firewalls are applied.

Client API Introduction
-----------------------

First start a server in another terminal. ::

    $ python -m p4p.server.cli test:array=areal

Now start python interactive shell.  Either run 'python', or if available 'ipython'.

Import and create a client :py:class:`p4p.client.thread.Context` for the PVAccess protocol. ::

    from p4p.client.thread import Context
    ctxt = Context('pva')

Now issue a :py:meth:`p4p.client.thread.Context.get` network operation for a PV named 'test:array'. ::

    val = ctxt.get('test:array')
    print val

Due to :ref:`unwrap` (which can be disabled) the type of 'val' is a :py:class:`p4p.nt.scalar.ntnumericarray`.
Which can be treated as a normal numpy array with additional attributes to access the timestamp and alarm information. ::

    print val[:5]
    print val.timestamp
    print val.severity

The underlying :py:class:`p4p.Value` can be accessed with the 'raw' attribute.
For types which are not automatically unwrapped, a :py:class:`p4p.Value` is returned. ::

    print val.raw.value
    print val.raw.alarm.severity

To change a value with a :py:meth:`p4p.client.thread.Context.put` operation. ::

    ctxt.put('test:array', [1,2,3])
    val = ctxt.get('test:array')
    print val

To start and stop a subscription with :py:meth:`p4p.client.thread.Context.monitor`
which returns a :py:class:`p4p.client.thread.Subscription`. ::

   def show(val):
      print val
   S = ctxt.monitor('test:array', show)
   # current value is printed when monitor subscription is created
   ctxt.put('test:array', [4,5,6])
   # subscription update with new value is printed
   S.close() # end subscription
