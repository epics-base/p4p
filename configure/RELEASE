# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE this file or any file it includes you must
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in the application's top level directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should also do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# Required dependency
#PVXS = /path/to/pvxs

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
#EPICS_BASE = /path/to/epics-base

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).local
